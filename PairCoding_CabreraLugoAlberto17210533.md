What is pair coding?

The method known as pair programming (in Spanish, pair programming) is used mainly in agile software development and, more specifically, in extreme programming (XP). Pair programming specifies that there are always two people working on code at the same time and that they sit together as much as possible. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of monitoring in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions: they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.
These two workers are typically assigned different roles: the programmer who has been assigned the pilot role writes the code. The programmer who has been assigned the copilot role is responsible for monitoring that code. One of the rules of pair programming states that these two roles are exchanged regularly (at short intervals). In this way, a possible hierarchical gap is avoided: equality between both workers is promoted and a fluid exchange of roles is achieved.

Advantages of pair coding
●	Organized programming.
●	Lower error rate
●	Satisfacion of the programmer  
●	Troubleshooting program errors  
●	New version
●	Implement a way of working where it adapts easily to the corcumstances
Disadvantages of pair coding
●	It is recommended to use it only in short-team projects
●	High commissions in case of failure 
●	Impossible to foresee everything before programming
●	Too expensive and unnecessary
 
Does pair coding really improve productivity?
An experiment was carried out in which the famous Ward Cunningham and Ron Jeffries participated, an experiment carried out at the University of Utah in 1999. In this experiment a group of experienced programmers had to do 3 programming exercises, a third of the group programmed in individually and the rest in pairs. And the following conclusions were drawn from the study:
●	Regarding the time it took for the first exercise, those who programmed in pairs used 15% more time than those who worked individually.
●	But the pair programming was cutting that time in the following exercises. All this due to the accommodation process that requires teamwork.
●	The programs resulting from the pair programming had, on average, 15% fewer bugs and followed the programming standards in a more correct way, reaching 30% fewer lines of code.
Points to avoid when pair coding
1) Both programmers have to be actively involved in the session, a very common mistake is that one or the other member of the team works at a lower intensity, which entails problems in terms of the coordination of both tasks.
2) This technique should not be considered as a duplicate cost, in any case, it would be the worst consequence of the incorrect application of the technique. Well applied Pair Programing never entails a higher cost but on the contrary, it is a highly efficient technique under the right circumstances.
3) Both programmers must establish a continuous dialogue about all the steps that are being carried out (pair programming also includes programming out loud or "programming out loud"). In the event that the driver does not offer constant communication, it would be the browser's obligation to intervene to change this situation.
4) Pair programming should never be imposed, it will be the programmers themselves who coordinate to execute it if they consider it appropriate, because if there are relationship or communication problems between them, it could be totally counterproductive to force them to do so.
